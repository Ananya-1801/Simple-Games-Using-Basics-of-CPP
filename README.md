# ðŸŽ® Simple Games Using Basics of C++

This repository contains two fun and interactive terminal games written in **C++**, using only **fundamental concepts** â€” no classes or object-oriented programming involved. These games are great for beginners looking to strengthen their understanding of functions, loops, conditionals, arrays, and basic logic building.

## Table Of Contents

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe
- Classic 3x3 two-player game (You vs Computer).
- Uses simple board logic, win conditions, and draw detection.
- Input is based on number positions from 1â€“9.

### 2. Rock-Paper-Scissors
- Play against the computer by choosing `r`, `p`, or `s`.
- Outcome is decided using basic condition checks and `rand()` for randomness.

---

## Concepts Covered

- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Control statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`while`, `do-while`)
- Arrays and character handling
- Random number generation (`rand()`, `srand()`)
- Basic function decomposition

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### ðŸ”§ Prerequisites
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++` or any IDE that supports C++ such as Code::Blocks, Dev C++, or VS Code with extensions).

### ðŸ’» Compile & Execute

For **Tic-Tac-Toe**:
```bash
g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe
./tic_tac_toe
